        <p>Hello, my name is Kiran Menezes. I am a running start student here at BC.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is the first time I have taken a programming class. I have had little to no experience with the coding
            languages we will be learning this quarter. I have used a basic programming tool call Scratch for school
            projects on occasion.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Through the quarter I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of computers, and I hope to gain an deeper
            understanding for programming.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, playing soccer, hanging out with friends, listening to music,
            and swimming.&nbsp;</p>
    </p>

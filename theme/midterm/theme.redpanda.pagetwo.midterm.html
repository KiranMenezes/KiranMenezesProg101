        <p>Red Pandas share the cold and wet high-altitude mountain forests as their bigger cousin, however
            the smaller species has a wider range. Red Pandas live in the mountains of Nepal and northern Burma,
            along with in central China.</p>

        <p>Unlike Giant Pandas, Red Pandas spend most of their time in the trees. These racoon looking creates have
            even been seen sleeping high in the branches of trees in the thick forests.

        <p>When foraging for food, Red Pandas will sniff out fruits, acorns, roots, and the eggs of birds. The
            Red Panda is such a good climber because just like the Giant Panda, the Red Panda has exteneded wrist bones
            that function almost as a thumb would, which aid their gripping abilities.</p>

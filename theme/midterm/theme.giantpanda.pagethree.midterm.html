        <h1>Threats to the Giant Panda</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The main threat to the Giant Panda populations around the world are huamns.</p>
        <h2>List of Threats</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fragmentation</li>
            <li>Habitat Loss</li>
            <li>Hunting</li>
            <li>Harvesting</li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        <h3>Fragmentation</h3>
        <p><img class="flt-img-right" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/23/05/bamboo-1851080_1280.jpg"
                alt="Red Panda Bear" height="350" width="350">As the Giant Pandas habitat continues to shrink, and the
            forests they live in become separated from one
            another, the groups of Pandas living in those forests are virtually trapped. This results in inbreeding
            within
            the Panda population inhabiting a certain area. Inbreeding can have devasting impacts on a species numbers
            in
            little time. The decline in numbers concerning an inbreeding population of Pandas is usually attributed to
            deaths
            from illness and disease to birth defects that are fatal.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
        <p><img class="flt-img-right" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/11/01/10/18/china-1016745_1280.jpg"
                alt="Red Panda Bear" height="350" width="350">Much of the Giant Pandas habitat has been lost due to
            logging for timber and wood fuel, or clearcut and
            utilized for
            agriculture and infrustructure to match the needs of the areas booming population. In 1998, the Chinese
            Government
            banned logging in the Panda Habitat. Saldy however, new highways and railroads that are being built are
            cutting
            through the region, which is fragmenting the forests. This further isolates panda populations and prevents
            them from
            breeding.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Hunting</h3>
        <p>Hunting and has had an impact on Giant Panda numbers. These fluffly bears were hunted for their fur and
            their numbers decreased gradually throughout the past hundred years. But due to strict laws and an increase
            in public
            awarness the population numbers have began to stabilize.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Poaching</h3>
        <p>Another threat to the Giant Pandas is poaching. Giant Pandas are an unusual target for poachers, these fluffy
            animals sadly
            get accidently injured or trapped in snares set by the poachers for game animals; such as musk deer or black
            bears.</p>

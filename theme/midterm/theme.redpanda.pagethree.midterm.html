        <h1>Threats to the Red Panda</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The main threat to the Red Panda populations around the world are huamns.</p>
        <h2>List of Threats</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Poaching</li>
            <li>Deforestation</li>
            <li>Competition with domesticated animals</li>
            <li>Pollution</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h3>Poaching</h3>
        <p>Illegal hunting of the Red Panda has had a severe impact on the species wild population. Due to
            the demand for the animals pelt, poaching incidence increased and the Panda population decreased.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>Deforestation</h3>

                alt="Red Panda Bear" width="350">Deforesation has created the most problems for the wild Red Pandas.
            With large sections of forrest
            gone, the populations of Red Pandas have been cut off from each other. This type of "isolation"
            results in potential inbreeding. Inbreeding can have many effects on the Red Panda population, deriving
            from birth defects which can contribute to illness, bodily failure, and more unpredictable results.</p>

        <br />
        <h3>Competition with Domesticated Animals</h3>
        <p>As the development of china continued, people who owned livestock had to move further out into the
            wilderness to graze their animals. Bringing the livestock further away from civilization meant that the
            farmers grazing locations would begin to encrouch on the Pandas habitat. Even though the livestock and the
            wild Pandas aren't in Competition for the same resources, the disruption caused to the land by the livestock
            has driven the Pandas into small areas that are more remote.<img class="flt-img-right"

        <br />
        <h3>Pollution</h3>
        <p>Another big threat to the Red Pandas is the pollution or waste generated by humans. The most common types of
            pollution, which are water pollution, air pollution, and garbage waste have had great impacts on the Red
            Pandas
            around the world. The chemicals from these pollutants will drive the animals away from areas they once lived
            in
            because of the contamination. As human civilizations grow, the Red Panda population has shrunk in size due
            to
            the growing amount of "trash" left in their home.

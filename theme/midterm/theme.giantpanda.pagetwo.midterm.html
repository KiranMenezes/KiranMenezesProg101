        <p>The Giant Panda exists mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming,
            deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland
            areas where it once lived.</p>

        <p>Wild Pandas that inhabit the high-altitude forests live in cold and wet environment. Luckily however,
            the Panda is well equipped to survive in this type of environment.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Pandas have been seen at elevations from ten thousand feet to thirteen thousand feet high in the
            mountains.</p>

        <p>The cuddly looking bears are often obsereved eating, sitting down on their haunches, in a relaxed
            sort of way, with their hind legs stretched out before them.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Even though Pandas seem to be lazy lumbering bears, they can swim with great ease and climb trees
            efficiently.</p>

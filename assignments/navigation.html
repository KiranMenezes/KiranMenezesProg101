                    alt="Red Panda Bear" height="350" width="350">As the Giant Pandas habitat continues to shrink, and
                the
                forests they live in become separated from one
                another, the groups of Pandas living in those forests are virtually trapped. This results in inbreeding
                within
                the Panda population inhabiting a certain area. Inbreeding can have devasting impacts on a species
                numbers
                in
                little time. The decline in numbers concerning an inbreeding population of Pandas is usually attributed
                to
                deaths
                from illness and disease to birth defects that are fatal.</p>

            <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>

            <p><img class="flt-img-right" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/11/01/10/18/china-1016745_1280.jpg"
                    alt="Red Panda Bear" height="350" width="350">Much of the Giant Pandas habitat has been lost due to
                logging for timber and wood fuel, or clearcut and
                utilized for
                agriculture and infrustructure to match the needs of the areas booming population. In 1998, the Chinese
                Government
                banned logging in the Panda Habitat. Saldy however, new highways and railroads that are being built are
                cutting
                through the region, which is fragmenting the forests. This further isolates panda populations and
                prevents
                them from
                breeding.</p>

        <section id="hunting">
            <h3>Hunting</h3>
            <p>Hunting and has had an impact on Giant Panda numbers. These fluffly bears were hunted for their fur and
                their numbers decreased gradually throughout the past hundred years. But due to strict laws and an
                increase
                in public
                awarness the population numbers have began to stabilize.

        <section id="poaching">
            <h3>Poaching</h3>

            <p>Another threat to the Giant Pandas is poaching. Giant Pandas are an unusual target for poachers, these
                fluffy
                animals sadly
                get accidently injured or trapped in snares set by the poachers for game animals; such as musk deer or
                black
                bears.</p>

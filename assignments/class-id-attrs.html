<h2>My Favorite Soccer Memory</h2>
  <p id="happy">Funnily enough, my favorite soccer memory take place at my Elementary School, Creek Side.</p> 
  
  <p>Two of my teamates and I carpooled to practice every week during soccer season,
      and on Thursdays we would get out early because of the amount of traffic.</p> 
  
  <p class="extra">My favorite memory was all three of us racing down the hallway in our soccer 
      uniforms to the car parked by the side walk.</p>

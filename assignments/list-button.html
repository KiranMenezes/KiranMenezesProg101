    <aside>This is an example of aside that I used for this assignment. I do realize that my buttons are very  
        colorful, but they are an experiment for this assignment. The text in this document is only for formatting

    </aside>
    <p>As the Giant Pandas habitat continues to shrink, and the forests they live in become separated  
        from one another, the groups of Pandas living in those forests are virtually trapped. 
        This results in inbreeding within the Panda population inhabiting a certain area. 
        Inbreeding can have devasting impacts on a species numbers in little time. 
        The decline in numbers concerning an inbreeding population of Pandas is usually attributed todeathsfrom illness 
        and disease to birth defects that are fatal. 
    </p>


    <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>

    <p>Much of the Giant Pandas habitat has been lost due tologging for timber and wood fuel, or clearcut 
        and utilized for agriculture and infrustructure to match the needs of the areas booming population. In 1998, the 
        Chinese Government banned logging in the Panda Habitat. Saldy however, new highways and railroads that are being 
        built are cutting through the region, which is fragmenting the forests. This further isolates panda populations 
        and prevents them from breeding. 
    </p>

    <h3>Hunting</h3>
    <p>
        Hunting and has had an impact on Giant Panda numbers. These fluffly bears were hunted for their fur andtheir
        numbers decreased gradually throughout the past hundred years. But due to strict laws and an increasein
        publicawarness the population numbers have began to stabilize.
    </p>

    <h3>Poaching</h3>
    <p>
        Another threat to the Giant Pandas is poaching. Giant Pandas are an unusual target for poachers, these
        fluffyanimals sadlyget accidently injured or trapped in snares set by the poachers for game animals; such as
        musk deer or blackbears.
